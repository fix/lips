Status: Draft

##Rationale
In order to ease the transaction liquidity, QRCode standard is proposed to support different Transaction Types. Also some dapp transactions could be embeded.

##Description
In order to ease the process for readibility and processing, JSON format is used. QRcode type is left to the choice of the implementer.
Also to reduce the general payload, shortcut name are used.

1. Communicating an address: `{"a":"<address of the account>"}`
2. Communicating a transaction: `{"t":"<transaction id>"}`
3. Requesting a payment of X LISK, to "recipient address": `{"type":0,"amount":X*100000000,"a":"<recipient address>"}`
4. Requesting a vote for "delegate address": `{"type":3,"pk":"<delegate publicKey>","u":"<delegate username>"}`

general meaning of keywords:
- "a": address of an account
- "t": transaction id
- "type": type of transaction, following the LISK definition:
```javascript
    0:"Send Lisk",
    1:"Signature Creation",
    2:"Delegate Registration",
    3:"Vote",
    4:"Multisignature Creation",
    5:"DApp Registration",
    6:"IN Transfer",
    7:"OUT Transfer"
```
- amount: amount of lisk, expressed in satoshi-lisk. For 1 Lisk, amount=100000000
- "n": network. values are "mainnet" or "testnet". Default is "mainnet"

##Example
Communicating fixcrypt address on the testnet network:
```javascript
{"a":"4362667931266743901L","n":"testnet"}
```

and result in the following QRCode:
